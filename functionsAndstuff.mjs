/*  Task 1
    Create a function that given an array of integers returns the largers number in the array.

/*  Task 2
    Create a function that returns an array of n posetive numbers (only integers), where n is given as a parameter.
    The numbers should be unique but not consecutive.
    Do not use any built in functionality for sorting, matching etc. (You may use Random and Math functions)
*/



/*  Task 3
    Create a function that given a string and a pattern returns true if the pattern matches the string.
    Do not use any built in functionality for matching (no regex)etc.

    A pattern is defined as a series of *,n,s and -.
    * matches anything except an empty string.
    n matches any number.
    s matches any string.
    - matches a single space.

    Example:
    pattern: sssss-nnn-*****
    string: "Hello 123 World"

/*  Task 4
    Create a function that reads an indetermind number of integers from the console and returns the sum of the numbers.
*/
let randomNumbers = [1, 4, 6, 7, 8];

function sum(randomNumbers) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < randomNumbers.length; i++)
        sum += randomNumbers[i];
    return sum;
};
console.log(sum(randomNumbers));



/*  Task 5
    Create a function that given a string returns the number of words in the string.
    Do not use any built in functionality for splitting strings etc.
*/
let stringToCount = [`Duck`, `You`, `You`, `Ducking`, `Duck`];


   
   console.log(countWords(stringToCount));

    










;




/*  Task 6
    Create the functions that given a color value in hex format reutns the RGB and CMYK values .
    Do not use any built in functionality.

    Hex is defined as #RRGGBB. Where RR, GG and BB are two digit hexadecimal numbers.
    RGB is defined as three integers between 0 and 255.
    CMYK is defined as four floats between 0 and 1.

    The conversion from RGB to CMYK is defined as:
    K = 1 - max(R, G, B) / 255
    C = (1 - R / 255 - K) / (1 - K)
    M = (1 - G / 255 - K) / (1 - K)
    Y = (1 - B / 255 - K) / (1 - K)

    Tip: 
    - You can use int.Parse("FF", System.Globalization.NumberStyles.HexNumber) to convert a hex number to an integer.
    - You can read a substring from a string using str.Substring(startIndex, length)
    - You can return multiple values from a function by using {}.
